The   Brazilian   Soil   Classification   System   (SiBCS)   separates   at   the   subgroup   level
classes with very high iron contents, identified as Perferrics (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>   equal or higher than 360 g
kg<sup>-1</sup>  by sulfuric acid extraction, referred as total iron) and Ferrics (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>  extracted by sulfuric
acid solution from 180 to 360 g kg<sup>-1</sup> ). These criteria were based on the study of Curi and
Franzmeier (1987) and are used in the Latosols, Nitosols and Cambisols orders. The main parent
materials of these soils are itabirite (a hematite-quartz metamorphic rock) and basalt. According
to WRB 2006 (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006), they are Ferralsols or Nitisols with the
Rhodic qualifier. The Rhodic qualifiers only refers to the color and is not directly related to the
iron content. Thus, new qualifiers were proposed during the revision of WRB, identified as
Ferritic and Hyperferritic, for soils having a layer, equal or thicker than 30 cm and starting
within 100 cm of the soil surface, with Fe extracted by dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) in
the fine earth fraction equal or higher than 10 % and 30 %, respectively, and not forming part of
a petroplinthic, pisoplinthic or plinthic horizon. The application of these criteria to Brazilian
soils, available in the ESALQ - USP database (http://www.esalq.usp.br/gerd/), resulted in a total
of 491 observations with high iron content (total iron). However, the information is based on the
total iron in the fine earth fraction, and a pedotransfer function has to be developed to predict
the dithionite-extractable iron from this data. Some soil properties related to the high iron
contents are parent material, CEC, clay texture, and color (hue and chroma), this last valid for
Rhodic Ferralsols and Rhodic Nitisols. A map of soils with high iron and a histogram of the
distribution, probability maps, variance and purity map were prepared with the Brazilian data
available. More data is necessary to model the relationship between dithionite-extractable Fe
and total Fe; however, the preliminary results validate the proposal of the new qualifiers in the
WRB.
